Overview

This repository hosts a series of Python scripts focusing on facial recognition to differentiate between children and adults. It leverages deep learning models, including variations of VGG models and ensemble methods, to analyze facial features and classify images.

Contents

VGG16.py: Implementation of the VGG16 model for facial recognition.
VGG19.py: Utilizes the VGG19 architecture for enhanced facial feature extraction.
VGGFace2.py: Adaptation of the VGGFace model for distinguishing between children's and adults' faces.
Ensembla Model.py: An ensemble approach combining features from various models for robust facial recognition.
Key Features

Utilizes state-of-the-art VGG architectures for deep learning-based facial recognition.
Comparison between children and adult facial features using advanced neural networks.
Ensemble model implementation to improve accuracy and reliability of predictions.
